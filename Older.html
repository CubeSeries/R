                <p>I built this webpage to keep track as log of my watched Kdrama on Netflix! Writing reviews helps me unpack my thoughts and feelings about each show, creating a personal record to revisit whenever I want, and give a honest and details opinion if asked about a serie. But it's not just for me. Sharing my reviews online helps others to wisely choose a serie among the others. Also, building and running this webpage is a fun creative outlet. It's a way to express my love for K-dramas and sharpen my writing and web design skills.</p> <br>

            The series revolves around the life of Do Do-Hee, a successful and ambitious CEO who is married to her job. Her world is turned upside down when she encounters Jung Gu-Won, a demon who is initially portrayed as a charming and powerful being with a penchant for human souls. Gu-Won's powers are based on the classic Faustian bargain, where he grants unlimited power for a limited time but ultimately sends the recipient to hell via heart attack in exchange.

In his first life, Gu Won was once a human named Yi Sun, who belonged to a noble family, he fell in love with a girl  named Wolsim, which later on we learn it was Do Do Hee. People had made Wolsim a scapegoat to protect themselves, and this closed all doors in Yi Sun's heart to accepting the good in human beings.

Hoping the erasure his memory would put him to peace but it did not erase the effect of witnessing Wolsim's death. For the two hundred years he acted as a demon, Gu Won remained completely detached from humans, considering himself above them and ignoring the loneliness within himself.

He actually came back to life, since "God" lost a bet to him, granting him a wish. Afterwards, they lived the happy love life that they both wished for. The end! <br><br>
            <h4>My Opinion:</h4>
            Having just finished watching "My Demon," I am left with a mix of emotions and thoughts about this drama. The show delves into the supernatural world with a unique twist, focusing on demons and their interactions with humans in a way that kept me intrigued throughout. I found the character development in "My Demon" to be particularly engaging. The complexity of the demons and their struggles with their own nature added depth to the story. The lead actors delivered strong performances, especially in portraying the internal conflicts and emotional turmoil of their characters. <br><br>
            The pacing of the drama was well-balanced, keeping me hooked with its mix of suspense, drama, and supernatural elements. The storyline had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing, and I appreciated how the show explored themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the blurred lines between good and evil. While there were moments where the plot felt a bit predictable, overall, "My Demon" managed to keep me invested in the characters and their journey. The visual effects and cinematography added to the overall atmosphere of the show, enhancing the supernatural elements and creating a captivating viewing experience. The drama offers a fresh take on the supernatural genre, blending elements of fantasy and human drama effectively which is refreshing to watching one in a while. <br><br>
            But on the other hand, there were too many questionable and hilarious scenes. Like when Gu Won pushes Do-Hee in the river to try getting his powers back, at first she thought he was going for 18+ or a kiss, im like damn girl you only met him 3 times, chill. Also, the writing gets messy towards the end. Gu Won is supposed to be immortal, but Do-Hee still tries to save him from a bullet. The show also confuses religious ideas. They show churches, the devil, and priests, but then talk about reincarnation, which isn't part of Christianity. They even show God as a beggar! The ending feels rushed because Do-Hee will eventually die of old age, while Gu Won lives forever. How can they have a love story if one of them dies at some point? <br><br>
            Overall, My Demon gets 6 out of 10 stars.

            <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
            The moment I started watching "The Glory," I was swept away by its raw intensity and emotional depth. This drama isn't afraid to delve into the dark side of human nature, exploring the devastating effects of school violence and bullying. The protagonist plan for revenge against those who wronged her in the past instantly drew me in. I found myself completely invested in her journey. What truly elevated the drama for me was its unflinching portrayal of bullying's lasting scars. The show doesn't shy away from the trauma inflicted, and while it's undeniably difficult to watch at times. The courage to tackle such a sensitive topic with such emotional honesty is truly commendable. <br><br>
            The best parts of the serie must be every move she makes which highly is calculated. Each reply, all actions, are like a perfectly aimed rock thrown at her enemies, chipping away at their power and peace. The more you watch, the more satisfying it gets. You just want to see her relentless attacks slowly demolish their own lives. <br><br>
            The exceptional performances further elevate the experience. The lead actress delivers a powerhouse performance, effortlessly transitioning between moments of heartbreaking vulnerability and steely determination. The supporting cast is equally impressive, breathing life into the complex web of relationships that drive the narrative forward. The cinematography is stunning, with visuals that perfectly capture the emotional tone of each scene. The music is equally impactful, creating a truly immersive atmosphere that enhances the story's emotional weight. The drama isn't just a show, it change life, by changing our point of view towards bullying. <br><br>
            Overall, The Glory gets 10 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

Though the two were not related, Eun-Hyeok showed deep concern and care towards Eun-Yu, treating her as his own sister. During the start of the apocalypse he was downstairs along with most of the survivors and witnessed the events there. Since he is the brain of the Green Home, he leads the remaining residents because of his calm-mindedness and intelligence. Eun-Hyeok is known for having the ability to stay calm and make rational decisions despite unimaginable events. In most of the episodes, Eun-Hyeok seems like he has no empathy and puts up a somewhat cold front towards others. He has shown to be intelligent in strategy and is willing to make tough decisions that proved difficult for his neighbours. Eun-Hyeok leads the group stuck, devising plans for food, water, electricity and fighting off monsters. He uses his skills and experience to bolster the Green Home defenses, offering a much-needed boost to their morale and survival chances.

                    With two people dead and the residents in disarray, they start mourning and blaming Lee Eun-Hyeok for what's happened. Eun-Hyeok struggles to keep the residents under control. After Suk-Hyun falling from the top of the stairs down to the ground floor unharmed, he was confronted how he can control the monsterazation. The residents scared decided to have a democratic vote to try and kick Hyun-Soo out, which ends with his stay but he was highly monitored and used like a weapon. Meanwhile, Hyun-Soo's internal struggles intensify as he battles the infection, leading to a harrowing scene where he hangs upside down from the ceiling, showcasing the ongoing battle within him. Also Sang-Wook's journey towards closure with Seung-Jae's memory culminates in a poignant moment of resolution. Yi-Kyung's storyline takes a significant turn as she ventures outside to find an answer for her husband death and the mysterious cursed he called. There she encounters soldiers, leading to a pivotal moment where she bargains for information about resisting monsterization, involving Hyun-Soo as a key figure in her negotiations, for her safety and the location and truth behind her husband. <br><br>
                    We also get to see the resident sticking together and start to get to know each other’s which gave them hope and a reason to fight. Like Hyun-Soo who talks openly to Eun-Yoo who admits she’s given up ballet and teaches him how to do her hand gesture from before; the middle finger trick. This small act of kindness is enough for Hyun-Soo to begin cutting his hair. It’s a symbolic gesture, one signifying him cutting away all the pain and grief he’s felt over the years. And many sacrificed they lives for the others, like, Jae-Hun fighting the security guard, he lost his arm during the fight and asked the others to throw the fire in the elevator to kill them both in order to others survive. <br><br>
                    As things started to get quiet and peaceful, a truck slams straight into the front doors, unloading a whole stack of men start gathering and killing the residents. In this moment we get to learn that some monsters are friendly, because while a kid was hidden in the vents, a green slimy monster hide him from those men. Their leader, Jung-Seop, believes that humans are the real monsters this is why they been killing people on the go, even in churches. <br><br>
                    Both Ji-Kyung and Sang-Wook work together and manage to down two soldiers before snatching up their gun and axe. The residents work together and pick off the different soldiers, one by one. Eventually, Hyun-Soo drops to the ground, after being stabed through the chest after downing another soldier, the other residents watch in horror. With Hyun-Soo taken away in a lift, Ji-Kyung manages to save and free the rest of the residents. Unaware of the commotion down below, Hyun-Soo awakens to find himself on the rooftop. He begins staggering off but as he does, Jung-Seop shoots him again. But one of the soldiers steps up and grabs Jung-Seop round the neck, knocking him over the edge. It turns out Jung-Seop wasn’t the real leader after all. He was simply the rabbit whereas this guy is the proverbial wolf. Holding out a bloodied hand, he tries to strike a deal with Hyun-Soo, just as a military helicopter flies over with a leaflet regarding the infection.  As the lift descends, Hyun-Soo prepares to meet the rest of the residents. <br><br>
                    Hyun-Soo returns telling them all to drop their weapons as he confirms the criminal is the same as. Tragedy strikes as Sang-Wook tries to escape with Yu-Ri, only to be ambushed. A desperate fight ensues. Hyun-Soo lets the infection take over, suddenly sprouting a wing where his arm used to be. The two fight and Hyun-Soo wins but can no longer control his transformation. Doo-Sik sacrifices himself to try and save Hyun-Soo from his dark fate. He manages to snap Hyun-Soo out of his monstrous state, but at the cost of his own life. This loss plunges Hyun-Soo into amnesia, adding another layer of despair. As the wings sink back and he returns to his human form. Sobbing uncontrollably, they collapse in one another’s arms. It’s a big moment, especially given Hyun-Soo’s lack of a father figure in his later years and in a way, Doo-Sik has filled in that spot.
                    Trust is further eroded as they debate the legitimacy of a military leaflet promising safety. Eun-Hyeok and Eun-Yu grapple with the idea of betraying Hyun-Soo, while Yi-Kyung contemplates using a hidden tracker. <br><br>
                    The serie ends with the outside world transforms into a snowy wasteland. The military arrives, surrounding the apartment complex. They knew the location since a resident betrayed them using the tracker. They had to use a hidden bunker offers a glimmer of hope, but it's short-lived. Grenades explode, forcing the residents to flee underground. In a heart-wrenching scene, Eun-Hyeok sacrifices himself to hold off the military, allowing the others to escape. The remaining survivors staring down the barrels of military guns and Ji-Kyung leading them towards an uncertain exist but one of them had the tracker activate, the military took them and Ji-Jyung had to cooperate to find her husband. <br><br>
                    <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
                    Sweet Home took me on a wild ride from start to finish! The suspense had me practically chewing my fingernails as the story unfolded. But this show goes beyond just fighting monsters. It tackles relatable themes like loneliness, depression, and the primal urge to survive. It even explores the internal struggle of becoming the very monsters we fear. The monsterization feels like a curse, a manifestation of our darkest desires taking over. The special effects are incredible, showing the gruesome transformations in chilling detail. The characters are all interesting and distinct, making me care about their fates. I kept wondering who would survive and who would succumb, who would make it to the next season! <br><br>
                    While some parts dragged a bit, the action scenes were fantastic, showcasing how the characters use anything they can find to stay alive. Yi-kyun's escape through the vent was particularly intense, leaving me breathless. It was fascinating to see how desperation can turn people into animals, forcing them to do anything to survive. The show masterfully portrays the emotional toll on everyone involved, not just the victims but also those who hurt them. The cliffhanger ending left me wanting more. We get glimpses of the world outside and hints about the monster outbreak's origins. So many unanswered questions about the characters fates and the nature of the monsters fuel the excitement for season 2. <br><br>
                    As I dove into Sweet Home Season 1, I was captivated by its sheer intensity and originality. What truly sets Sweet Home apart is its unique blend of horror, action, and character-driven storytelling. The unflinching portrayal of transformations and intense fight scenes kept me on the edge of my seat, while the characters emotional depth and personal struggles added complexity to the narrative. The performances are outstanding, with Song Kang delivering a standout portrayal of the brooding and mysterious Cha Hyun-soo. The supporting cast shines as well, breathing life into the diverse group of residents. <br><br>
                    Beyond the compelling story and acting, I was impressed by the technical aspects. The cinematography, visual effects, and production values create an immersive and atmospheric experience, further enhancing the intensity of the horror elements and the emotional impact of the story. <br><br>
                    Overall, Sweet Home Season 1 gets 8 out of 10 stars for season 1. <br><br>

Despite her concern over their injuries, she warmly embraces them, symbolizing the closure and new beginnings for the characters. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
While the story of "Bloodhounds" might not be the most original, it kept me glued to the screen. I found myself laughing more than expected thanks to the show's silly moments, and the undeniable chemistry between the lead duo which had me rooting for them from the very beginning. The action scenes were top-notch, and the acting, especially from the leads, was phenomenal during the train station fight. It's a suspenseful show with a great storyline, well-written characters, and fantastic action sequences that showcase the unbreakable bond between Gun-woo and Woo-jin. <br><br>
Despite being only 8 episodes, the show never felt rushed, even with the unexpected departure of one character near the end. The performances, particularly Gun-woo and Woo-jin's, were amazing, their fighting skills were seriously impressive! I loved seeing Woo Do-hwan and Lee Sang-yi showcase their impressive boxing skills, and the camerawork during these scenes added to the intensity and excitement. The way the show initially set up the conflict and introduced the villain, Kim Myeong-gil, was impressive too. His despicable character full of hypocrisy, cruelty, and cold violence – genuinely evoked hatred in me. <br><br>
However, around episode 6, the show took a sharp turn. The pacing slowed down, the plot became careless, and new characters were introduced without development. I was particularly disappointed with the handling of the revenge plot. Having anticipated an epic showdown between the leads and Kim Myeong-gil, I felt the writers lost their way. The final episodes were confusing and unsatisfying, with many unanswered questions. Their friendship was one of the few bright spots in the later episodes, and I'm glad they didn't kill off Woo-jin. You can say the first half was excellent, but the second half was a letdown but I still enjoyed watching it. <br><br>
Overall, Bloodhounds gets 8 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/fvcEgIUZMks1cZPgZTnIHqUArtN.jpg">
The series "The Good Bad Mother" starts with Young-soon and her husband Hae-shik happily living on a pig farm. But their happiness is shattered when a corrupt construction company burns down their farm. Things get worse when Hae-shik is falsely accused of starting the fire and is eventually murdered. Determined to start anew, Young-soon moves to a new village where she meets another mother named Geum-ja. They both have babies around the same time, forming a close bond between their families. <br><br>
Years later, Young-soon's intense focus on her son Kang-ho's studies strains their relationship. This tension peaks when Kang-ho skips an important exam to help an injured Mi-joo, causing conflict between him and Young-soon. Meanwhile, Mi-joo deals with her own family troubles. Kang-ho becomes a prosecutor but gets involved in shady dealings for revenge, while Mi-joo works hard as a single mother to open her own business. When Young-soon tries to reconnect with Kang-ho in Seoul, he rejects her. <br><br>
Kang-ho's revenge against corrupt prosecutor Oh Tae-soo leads him to manipulate Oh's daughter, Ha-young, into a relationship. But their plans are threatened when Oh pressures Kang-ho to end things. Kang-ho discovers a secret: a paternity test reveals a child fathered by Oh belongs to Song's secretary. Using this information, Kang-ho manipulates Song into approving his legal adoption, intending to marry Ha-young.

Passing on her wedding rings to Kang-ho and Mi-joo symbolizes their future together, and Young-soon peacefully passes away with Kang-ho singing her a lullaby at her funeral. <br><br>
Reunited with his family, Kang-ho proposes to Mi-joo in a playful yet heartwarming way. Their laughter fills the air as they chase after a runaway piglet with a ring attached. With their new pig farm decorated with family photos, they prepare for their wedding, feeling a wave of emotions as Kang-ho reads Young-soon's apology letter. He seeks her guidance as he prepares to propose to Mi-joo, who accepts with a radiant smile. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
The series left me with a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I truly appreciate its realistic portrayal of motherhood. The show doesn't sugarcoat the challenges, it dives into the messy realities of family relationships. The characters are flawed and relatable, which makes them all the more endearing. For instance, there's a scene where Young-soon snaps at her son Kang-ho for not helping out around the farm and being lazy, which was hilarious and relatable. It's a frustrating moment, but it also feels real. The acting, particularly the lead actress, is phenomenal. Her portrayal of Young-soon is emotionally intense and authentic. There's a scene where she breaks down after receiving bad news, and the raw vulnerability she conveys is truly captivating. I couldn't help but feel a wave of empathy for her character. <br><br>
The show's balance between humor and heart is also a highlight. It manages to be funny, heartwarming. This unique blend makes it stand out in the healing comedy genre. However, the pacing did drag a bit, especially in the beginning. Some parts felt like they could have been tightened up to keep the momentum going. There were moments when I found myself losing interest and wondering when the story would pick back up. Additionally, some of the supporting characters, while interesting, could have been developed further. They felt a bit one-dimensional at times. For instance, Kang-ho's childhood friend could have played a more prominent role in his emotional journey. <br><br>
I have to admit that the writing is sharp, the characters are well-developed, even if some could use a bit more depth, and the emotional journey is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. It's not your typical K-drama, and that's what makes it stand out. But be prepared from some crying scene specialy at her death. <br><br>
Overall, The Good Bad Mother gets 8 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

Despite unresolved questions and unexplored darker themes, the finale sets the stage for a potential second season. <br><br>
                        <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
                        This drama hooked me with its unique concept: an app that detects romantic feelings. The idea is both fascinating and unsettling, and the show delves deeply into the consequences of such technology on our lives. Kim Jo-jo is the character who truly resonated with me. Her journey of self-discovery and navigating love in a world obsessed with quantifying emotions felt relatable and powerful, she didn’t feel wrong to be different from other by not downloading the app at first. The actress delivered a stellar performance, portraying a range of emotions with incredible subtlety.
                        The supporting cast shines as well, adding layers and complexity to the story. I particularly enjoyed the dynamic between Hwang Sun-oh and Lee Hye-yeong. Their friendship and rivalry added a layer of tension that kept me engaged, I thought they would go on 1 v 1 fight to win her heart since I felt Sun-oh was a spoiled kid  but they were friends rather than ennemi, adding a fight scene could have been interesting though. <br><br>
                        What I truly appreciated about "Love Alarm" was its willingness to tackle tough social issues like bullying, sexual assault, and societal pressures. The show didn't shy away from these sensitive topics, handling them with maturity. The way Hye-yeong handled the fact that a boy loved him was quite impressive. I was expecting some kind of fight ngl between them since before this scene the same boy bullied another boy for loving him. But can we talk about the first time Kim Jo-jo and Hwang Sun-oh, like  damn girl, I wouldn't kiss a guy I met a minute ago and surprisingly fell inlove with hin the next day. <br><br>
                        However, while the concept is interesting, the idea of blindly trusting an app for your love life felt unrealistic to me. I mean, who would let an app dictate their emotions? The show does explore the darker side of this reliance on technology, which I appreciated. I wasn’t a big fan of the quick ending leaving me hanging.  <br><br>
                        Overall, Love Alarm Season 1 gets 7 out of 10 stars for season 1. <br><br>

                        Four years after the launch of Love Alarm, the upgraded version, Love Alarm 2.0, is a major development under the leadership of Brian Chon, the CTO. Jojo, running late to class, receives a message from Lee Hye-Yeong asking to meet. They meet at the cafeteria where Hye-Yeong humorously demonstrates the love alarm’s function and talks about Love Alarm 2.0, hinting it will eventually make Jojo love him. Despite enjoying her time with Hye-Yeong, Jojo feels conflicted. At his apartment, as they share a moment, the curtain pole falls, interrupting a potential kiss. Meanwhile, Sun-O, feeling melancholic during a photo shoot with Yuk-Jo, leaves midway, still affected by his feelings for Jojo and the sensitive love alarm topic. At home, Sun-O faces criticism from his parents, with his father berating him and his mother focusing on money and hiding her smoking habit. <br><br>
                        Meanwhile Gul-Mi, struggling with her live stream, shifts focus to Jojo by revealing her as the artist behind The Ringing World, attracting a shady man who later chases Jojo. Hye-Yeong saves her and invites her to stay at his place. As they rehang the curtains, Jojo kisses Hye-Yeong on the cheek but remains unsure about her feelings. The next morning, Gul-Mi learns about developers caught for creating a fake love alarm code. She collaborates with one of them, agreeing to help in exchange for assistance. Meanwhile, Jojo suspects Brian Chon might be Duk-Goo and searches for him. Back at school, her love alarm rings, revealing Sun-O behind the door. <br><br>
                        Later, Sun-O meet and start catching up with Jojo at school, inquiring about Hye-Yeong and her well-being. Jojo avoids answering and leaves. At the police station, Jojo learns Duk-Goo is dead, leaving her devastated and crying on the school steps. Sun-O sees her but chooses not to approach. Jojo reflects on Duk-Goo’s concepts of the shield and sword. She later visits Hye-Yeong, and they enjoy a romantic evening together. Jojo suggests a trip abroad, and they discuss Brian Chon, whom Hye-Yeong hasn't met yet. Hye-Yeong expresses his unwavering affection for Jojo before they part ways. Sun-O, conflicted, decides to attend a press conference for Badge Club members. The next day, Jojo shows her best friend Mun-Win a message from Brian Chon, suspecting he might be Duk-Goo. Jojo activates her shield and arranges to meet Hye-Yeong, but he declines due to visiting his father in prison. She leaves strawberries at his door anyway. <br><br>
                        At the Badge Club event, Jojo meets with Brian Chon and discusses the shield feature, seeking to remove it to understand her true feelings. She deduces that Brian Chon is indeed Duk-Goo, who confirms that the shield can't be removed and that Duk-Goo is gone. As Jojo leaves, Sun-O confronts her about the shield, and she apologizes for not being honest, leaving her in a tough spot with Hye-Yeong still unaware of the shield. Jojo, admits to Sun-O that she installed the shield because of him, though she claims it no longer concerns him. Sun-O, aware of Jojo's lingering feelings, chases after her as she leaves the Badge Club, then confronts Brian Chon about the shield, accusing it of ruining his life. Meanwhile, Hye-Yeong worrying about his father's past and how Jojo might react if she knew. <br><br>
                        Hye-Yeong finds Jojo at a bus stop and lies about being home all day, which she later realizes was untrue when she sees the strawberries she left still on his door. The next day, Hye-Yeong visits his mother, who is upset about his father. He then encounters Sun-O, who mentions his earlier meeting with Jojo and questions why Hye-Yeong's love alarm hasn't rung. Hye-Yeong meets Jojo, apologizes for lying, and heads to visit his father in prison. Hye-Yeong's father claims to have changed due to religion, but when he demands his son sign release forms, Hye-Yeong refuses and leaves, breaking down in tears. Meanwhile, Gul-Mi is instructed by the CDG developer to gain 300 hearts to join the Badge Club. <br><br>
                        Brian Chon is shown in Duk-Goo’s apartment, accessing a computer with information about swords and shields. Sun-O and Yuk-Jo argue, ending their relationship due to Sun-O's unresolved feelings for Jojo. After meeting her, Sun-O advises Jojo to search her heart for her true feelings. They get caught in the rain and are drenched. Jojo later receives a message from Hye-Yeong about the rain and visits him at work, hugging him and crying. Brian Chon watches them through a camera, then gets a police request for Love Alarm logs to catch the dock killer. Hye-Yeong walks Jojo home, making her laugh by ringing her love alarm with a silly dance. Jojo notices a suspicious message on Gul-Mi’s phone but leaves it unanswered. Sun-O follows Jojo from a distance on the bus and confronts her about their breakup. He leaves to find Yuk-Jo, who has moved on and leaves with another man. <br><br>
                        Jojo misses Hye-Yeong, who searches for her and ends up at a convenience store where Gul-Mi works. Hye-Yeong and Sun-O fight physically and verbally, each accusing the other of selfishness. Hye-Yeong finds Jojo on a bench, hugs her, and takes her to his apartment.  Jojo later opens a link from an unknown number about the Spear, which can ring anyone’s love alarm. That night, she tells Sun-O she’s choosing Hye-Yeong and that he hasn’t been on her mind. She reflects on her photos with Hye-Yeong and, determined, uses the Spear to make Hye-Yeong’s love alarm ring, signifying her decision to be with him. <br><br>

As they walk away, the tape player starts, showcasing a touching montage of their love alarm moments, encapsulating their journey together. <br><br>
                        <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
                        Is Season 2 worth watching? Here's the thing, I find it's a mixed bag. There are still good moments, and it touches on important themes. But it doesn't live up to the first season. If you're a fan, give it a shot, but don't expect the same emotional impact.
                        Season 2 left me with conflicting feelings. While Season 1 was a breath of fresh air in the romantic drama genre, exploring the complexities of love in a digital age. The pacing was a major sticking point for me. The story felt jumpy and rushed, like the writers were cramming too much into too few episodes. This lead to characters development suffered, and I also felt disconnected from the various storylines. It felt forced, like they were trying to manufacture a connection that wasn't there. <br><br>
                        Another letdown was the shift in focus. Introducing new characters is great, but Season 2 spent so much time on them that the original cast felt neglected. I missed the dynamic between the characters from Season 1, their chemistry and emotional depth were what made the show so captivating. However, it's not all doom and gloom. The show still tackles important social issues, like societal pressures and technology's impact on relationships, like some group of people suicide due to they love alarm never rang.
                        Thankfully, the acting remains strong. The cast delivers solid performances despite the script's limitations. <br><br>
                        The reason why season 2 was mostly hated is because of Jojo's New Love Interest. Most team were on team Sun-ho, we wanted her to end up with Sun-ho. But another reason could be that in Season 1 at the ending there was a cliffhanger, but in Season 2 they did not continue with that! They just showed at least 1 or 2 months later. The storyline was overall, confusing. I mean it was shown 4 years later, So love should be kinda mature. The chemistry between Hye-yeong and Jojo was nothing compared to Sun-ho and Jojo. We don’t even know that how Jojo became Hye-yeong’s gf. They introduced us Hye-yeong as Jojo's new love interest, just a few episodes in, are we supposed to believe she's fallen for him? There's barely any build-up or chemistry between them. The writers try to compensate with a grand confession scene, but it falls flat because their relationship development feels rushed. <br><br>
                        The show also struggled to juggle multiple storylines without giving them proper attention. Take Jojo's best friend Duk-gu. His struggle with sexuality was an interesting addition, but it felt underdeveloped and overshadowed by the main love triangle. I can say Season 2 was a huge disappointment compared to the first season, but it has its moments. <br><br>
                        Overall, Love Alarm Season 2 gets 5 out of 10 stars for season 2. <br><br>

<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
The drama hooked me from the start! It's not your typical K-drama. I can't help but be impressed by the show's unique premise and the emotional journey it takes viewers on. The drama follows the story of a woman named Kang Ji Won, who tragically loses her husband in a car accident. However, in a twist of fate, she is given the chance to go back in time and prevent his death, but at a cost, she must marry him again. One of the things I appreciated most about "Marry My Husband" was the way it explored the complexities of grief and the power of love to transcend time and space. The show didn't shy away from the raw emotions that come with losing a loved one, and I found myself deeply invested in Ji Won's journey as she grappled with the decision to change the past. <br><br>
The performances in "Marry My Husband" were also a standout for me. Park Min-young delivered a powerful and nuanced portrayal of Ji Won, conveying the character's pain, hope, and determination with equal intensity. Her chemistry with Na In-woo, who played her husband and CEO was palpable, and I found myself rooting for their relationship. Another aspect of the show that I enjoyed was the way it incorporated elements of fantasy and time travel without losing sight of the emotional core of the story. The time travel mechanics were well-explained and didn't feel like a gimmick, and I appreciated the way the show used it to explore deeper themes about the nature of love and sacrifice. <br><br>
However, the middle dragged a bit. Some plot points felt repetitive, and the story could have benefited from tighter pacing. Despite this minor flaw, "Marry My Husband" remains a compelling and emotionally resonant drama. The show's willingness to tackle difficult topics like loss, combined with the unique premise and strong performances, makes it a standout. What truly elevates the show for were Ji Won's growth; she realized that some things are inevitable forces her to take control and manipulate events to protect herself and others around her which the series more interesting to watch. This keeps the story moving and avoids typical time travel tropes. And also, the show compels you to consider how you'd handle a second chance. It encourages taking action and making choices you won't regret. Ji Won's positive attitude definitely influences those around her. <br><br>
Overall, Marry My Husband gets 8 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/rBuCoS0VB9M6zkEUCvnVrfeF0J.jpg">
Kang Chul, a young Olympic gold medalist, faces a tragic turn when his family is murdered with his own pistol in 2006, leading to his arrest and a challenging trial. Concurrently, Oh Yeon-joo, a hospital resident, uncovers her father's plan to kill off Kang Chul in his popular manhwa "W." Upon investigating her father's latest drawings, Yeon-joo is drawn into the manhwa world, where she saves Kang Chul's life. As she returns to the real world, she realizes the manhwa reflects her actions, and Kang Chul, believing she holds the key to his existence, seeks her out. Suspicious of her father's involvement in the webtoon universe, Yeon-joo confronts him about his eagerness to eliminate Kang Chul. She discovers her father's awareness of the webtoon's reality and his plot against Kang Chul. In a hospital within the manhwa world, Yeon-joo prevents an assassination attempt on Kang Chul, earning his trust as he becomes intrigued by her appearances and knowledge. <br><br>
Yeon-joo's confrontation with her father leads to a blurring of the lines between the real and manhwa worlds. Her father, panicked, decides to end the webtoon abruptly. Kang Chul, having survived an assassination attempt, realizes an external force controls his fate and challenges his creator, sparking a deeper conflict. Yeon-joo returns to the manhwa world, finding her father missing, and reveals to Su-bong the connection between her appearances in the manhwa and Kang Chul. She suspects her father's plan to kill Kang Chul and uncovers notes hinting at mysterious changes in the manhwa. After collapsing, Yeon-joo re-enters the manhwa, where Kang Chul's assistant finds her unconscious. Kang Chul takes her to his penthouse and investigates her ability to appear and disappear, believing she's from another dimension due to her invincibility. In the real world, Su-bong learns of Yeon-joo's disappearance and her father's struggles with the changing manhwa. Kang Chul tests Yeon-joo's invulnerability by shooting her, confirming his belief in her interdimensional nature. Despite the risks, Kang Chul remains determined to uncover the truth, while Yeon-joo grapples with her extraordinary abilities and their impact on both realities. <br><br>
Meanwhile, Kang Chul meets Ajusshi, who expresses concerns about Chul's recent street attack and his decision to hide Yeon-joo from the police. Chul realizes the attacks have been mysterious and speculates that the attacker might be from another dimension, similar to Yeon-joo. Yeon-joo receives designer items from Chul's staff, leading to a playful yet tense conversation with Chul about their relationship. Later, So-hee deceives Yeon-joo into a restaurant where she gets arrested by the police. Chul defends Yeon-joo to the press and dismisses So-hee for her betrayal. Exhausted, Yeon-joo reveals the truth to Chul: they exist in a manhwa, and he is the main character. When Yeon-joo disappears back to her world, time freezes in Chul's world, with Chul being the only one unaffected. He begins to understand his reality, sees a portal similar to one from his stabbing incident, and decides to enter it, armed with determination and a gun. He emerges in Yeon-joo's world, symbolizing a rebirth akin to his earlier transformative experience. <br><br>
Kang Chul's life is upended when he discovers he's a character in a webtoon. Upon entering the real world through a mysterious frame, he finds an ad for his own webtoon and reads about his life at a bookstore. Shocked but composed, Chul realizes the story's popularity but declines to take the books since he already knows the story. Yeon-joo encounters Chul at the hospital, where he explains his situation and expresses regret for not heeding her warnings earlier. He bids her goodbye before her surgery, leaving her stunned.

A gunshot is heard in Yeon-joo’s father's workshop, and outside, Su-bong mistakenly thinks he's been shot. Inside, Yeon-joo’s father collapses with a chest wound, and Kang Chul calmly walks out with a gun. Yeon-joo rushes to the scene and takes over CPR in the ambulance.

The next day, a new episode of the manhwa shows Kang Chul's self-awareness and shooting his creator. He then jumps off a bridge, and the webtoon ends with "The End." <br><br>
Yeon-joo’s father reveals that he couldn’t bring Kang Chul back because he became a hero in the manhwa, and they must end it to keep her safe. Yeon-joo later sees Kang Chul suspended in water in a vision, and the webtoon changes from "The End" to "To be continued." Yeon-joo and Su-bong decide to save Kang Chul, even though it’s challenging without her father. After much effort, Su-bong starts drawing the rescue scene. In the manhwa world, a rescue boat saves Kang Chul, and Yeon-joo wakes up in prison, smiling as she’s back in Kang Chul’s world.In this segment, Su-bong reveals that Kang Chul, a character created by Yeon-joo when she was younger, was inspired by a real-life Olympic shooter. Yeon-joo recalls sketching traits she admired, which later formed the basis for Kang Chul. In the present, Kang Chul awakens and rushes to see Yeon-joo, who is being transported. He stops the transport and she explains that she saved him, showing a callus from drawing. She asks for his help to get out legally. Yeon-joo declares that their story is now a romance, not her father's violent tale. Kang Chul, feeling like a toy in someone else's story, is conflicted. Yeon-joo confesses her love tearfully, and after briefly vanishing, reappears. They kiss passionately, unnoticed by a returning detective. <br><br>

Chul and Yeon-joo discuss the manhwa's ending and No-Face's demands. Yeon-joo cuts her finger while cooking, revealing her vulnerability in the manhwa world. Chul consoles So-hee, whose existence is threatened, realizing No-Face has become self-aware. Yeon-joo confronts No-Face but returns to Chul's world before being shot. Chul devises a plan to reset everything by having Yeon-joo draw him waking up from a dream, erasing all memories of her. Yeon-joo reluctantly agrees, and Chul bids her an emotional farewell before jumping off a rooftop to reset his story. The reset succeeds, and Chul wakes in the hospital with no memory of Yeon-joo, while she tearfully completes the new frames in her world, separating their paths. <br><br>
Kang Chul instructs Yeon-joo to reset his memory, effectively rebooting the manhwa world. He jumps off a roof to send her back to her world. The No-Face Killer confronts Yeon-joo's father on a flight, demanding his identity before vanishing. Yeon-joo resets the manhwa, and Kang Chul wakes up with no memory of recent events. The No-Face Killer disappears, leaving three victims. In the reset manhwa, Kang Chul and the main characters are saved from disappearing. Yeon-joo's father returns to Korea, disturbed by a webtoon frame showing Yeon-joo with a bullet hole in her forehead. He finds a flash drive containing a letter from Kang Chul, urging him to create a happy ending for his daughter. Yeon-joo intermittently glimpses Kang Chul in her dreams, seeing him briefly before returning to her world. As Kang Chul recovers, he stops dreaming of her and resumes his heroic duties.

Su-bong reveals that her father was possessed by the New-Face Killer and forced to draw scenes for the manhwa, causing his face to disappear. Yeon-joo decides to return to the manhwa world to save Kang Chul despite Su-bong's warnings. In the manhwa world, Yeon-joo uses her father's tablet to erase evidence and change details to protect Kang Chul. She then begins drawing medical supplies for Chul, who uses them to treat himself. The New-Face Killer confronts Yeon-joo through the tablet, but she manages to sever his connection by shutting it down. Yeon-joo realizes she needs to save Kang Chul and travels back to the manhwa world, finding herself in Assemblyman Han's office. She narrowly escapes and learns that a month has passed. She meets Do-yoon, who tells her where to find Chul. They reunite, and Chul reveals that he knows about their relationship and the events that transpired. Chul and Yeon-joo navigate the complex intersections of their worlds as Kang Chul transitions between the manhwa and reality. Chul confronts Yeon-joo about his identity as her husband, which triggers a freeze in the manhwa world. He takes her hand and leads her through a portal to her world, ending up in her father's office where they discover her father's tablet. <br><br>

Outside, Su-bong and Seok-bum provide comic relief, emphasizing their anxiety about the situation. Chul assures Yeon-joo that he won't repeat past mistakes and reassures her of his intentions. Despite the chaos, Chul remains focused, examining the tablet and dismantling it to prevent further danger. He learns from Su-bong about the recent events, including the faceless Yeon-joo’s father and New-Face's manipulation. Chul, displaying his resourcefulness, plans to counteract the threats. Chul spends the night piecing together the manhwa's story and reflecting on his relationship with Yeon-joo. The next day, Chul calls Yeon-joo for a date, and they share a heartfelt conversation about their complicated relationship. Chul's hand flickers, signaling his instability as a hero, and he reveals the truth about his fading existence. <br><br>
Kang Chul devises a plan to defeat New-Face and restore order in the manhwa world. He successfully transitions back into the manhwa and subdues New-Face. Yeon-joo uses the tablet to assist Chul, and the police capture New-Face. However, the story takes a dark turn when Chul finds a rotting corpse in his hideout, hinting at further complications. Chul discovers he can freely move between the manhwa world and the real world. He orchestrates a plan to expose Assemblyman Han's crimes with the help of New-Face, who has escaped police custody. However, New-Face kidnaps Yeon-joo and shoots her in a dramatic confrontation. Kang Chul rushes to her side in the real world, where she lies unconscious and fighting for her life in the hospital. In a whirlwind of events, Kang Chul is tortured by Assemblyman Han, who demands answers about the tablet's powers. Chul manages to summon Han Chul-ho to the real world, leading to a chaotic confrontation where Yeon-joo's father draws Yeon-joo back to life. As the story races towards its conclusion, tensions rise, and Yeon-joo and Chul must make difficult decisions about their future. In the final episode of the webtoon "W," Kang Chul, Yeon-joo, and Yeon-joo’s father are trapped in the manhwa world until the ending, whether happy or sad. <br><br>
Facing imminent danger, Kang Chul proposes erasing Yeon-joo from his family registry to protect her. However, Yeon-joo refuses to accept any ending where they are separated, insisting they all leave together. Despite Yeon-joo's determination, Chul worries about her future in the manhwa world. Ultimately, Yeon-joo decides they will live out their lives in the manhwa world together. In a showdown with Assemblyman Han, Chul is shot, seemingly dying in Yeon-joo's arms. However, when Yeon-joo vanishes from the manhwa world, it continues without freezing, indicating an alternate resolution. It's revealed that Yeon-joo’s father orchestrated Kang Chul's survival by sacrificing himself and Assemblyman Han. Yeon-joo’s father leaves a letter for Chul, expressing his love and acceptance of his fate as a character in the manhwa world. Chul spends two more years in prison, but when he's released, he reunites with Yeon-joo, and they embrace their future together, hoping for a peaceful, ordinary life. <br><br>

Imagine getting sucked right into your favorite comic book! That's what happens to Oh Yeon-joo, a heart doctor in the real world. Suddenly, she's face-to-face with Kang Chul, the main character of her comic. But Kang Chul isn't just a drawing anymore. He's a real guy with dreamy eyes and a mysterious past.

The characters are awesome too, not just one-dimensional like characters in a comic. Lee Jong-Suk does a fantastic job playing Kang Chul.

The special effects in "W: Two Worlds" are amazing. They smoothly switch between the colorful comic world, which looks exactly like a real comic book, and the real world. It's like stepping right into the pages! <br><br>
But what really makes "W: Two Worlds" special is what it makes you think about. The show asks questions about what's real and what's not. It shows how strong love can be, with Yeon-joo determined to save Kang Chul no matter what even if he was a webtoon character. There's also a lot about making sacrifices for the people you care about. Also can we take about the draws and posters hanging around the whole series, they are stunning, even Knag Chul in the drawings look so similar to Lee Jong-Suk. "W: Two Worlds" isn't just a drama, it's an adventure! It'll make you question everything, fall in love with a unique romance, and wait on the edge of your seat for the next crazy twist. If you want a Korean drama with a fresh idea, fantastic acting, and a story that mixes fantasy, love, and suspense, "W: Two Worlds" is a must-watch! <br><br>
Overall, W: Two Worlds Apart gets 9 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h3>"If there's really such a thing as soulmates, I think she was mine."</h3>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/49/e2/bc/49e2bcebe2990a1b7453851e84e6ae7a.jpg">
The serie start with Park Hoon’s father framed and sent to North Korea to cure its leader. He was purposely sent there by Myungwoo University Hospital chairman to avoid a law suit against the hospital for malpratice. But to make sure that the father stays there, he son was sent alongside with him. There he grew and became a famous doctor for his exceptional skills in thoracic surgery. <br><br>
However, his world crumbles when his father, a respected doctor himself, is framed for malpractice and murdered and his girlfriend and future wife to which he propose went to a concentration camp. This devastating event becomes a turning point in Hoon's life, igniting a burning desire for escaping and revenge against those responsible. <br><br>
Desperate to escape the corrupt system and protect his ill girlfriend, Hoon flees North Korea, but fate deals another cruel blow. During their harrowing escape attempt, his girlfriend seems to tragically die from a bridge, leaving him utterly alone and consumed by grief. He arrives in South Korea under the name of Do In-soo, a talented surgeon facing constant suspicion due to his origins. <br><br>
While working and living his live as a water delivery, he encounter Han Seung-hee, who is now a resident doctor, whom he believed died during the escape. Their connection reignites, offering a glimmer of solace amidst the darkness. However, a cruel twist of fate reveals a tangled web of secrets. Seung-hee is now working with the North Korean soldiers and spies that want Hoon dead as revenge for escaping and leading them into trouble. <br><br>
Determined to expose the corrupt minister who'd been pulling the strings since the beginning, Park Hoon and Seung-hee planned to reveal the truth to the president. The minister, who'd been manipulating the president into an unconscious state to seize power, would finally be held accountable. However, in a shocking turn of events, the president betrayed them. While the minister escaped punishment, he wasn't spared entirely. <br><br>
The spy he hired with Han Seung-hee to eliminate Park Hoon got revenge for their betrayal and attempted to kill the minister. True to his oath as a doctor, Park Hoon, despite the betrayal, saved the minister's life, honoring his father's words to "never forget he was a doctor." As they were trying to escaped to save they lives, they were again attacked by the spy on a bridge. This time, Park Hoon refused to let Seung-hee sacrifice herself, and it was implied that both might have perished. Thankfully, the drama's ending revealed they were still alive. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
Oh man, those surgery scenes in Dr. Stranger were incredible! So realistic and intense, you could practically feel the pressure. And Dr. Park and Dr. Oh? Their bond is something special, truly one of a kind. It's pure, genuine, and way beyond what most people experience. They're not tied down by marriage or typical friendships, they're just free spirits who are always there for each other, even if it means teasing the heck out of each other sometimes. They made me laugh and cry, sometimes in the same scene! <br><br>
Dr. Stranger isn't just your average drama, it dives deep into the high-stakes world of surgery. Every operating room scene is like a mini-thriller, showcasing the complex procedures and the immense pressure these doctors face. The story itself is definitely unique, but with so many episodes, it did feel a bit repetitive at times. Still, Dr. Stranger doesn't shy away from the big stuff: revenge, redemption, the human spirit's ability to keep going even after huge losses. It also explores the fascinating differences in how doctors are viewed and treated in North and South Korea. <br><br>
Overall, Dr Stranger gets 5 of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h3>If you don’t feel happy yourself, what’s the point of saving others?</h3>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU5YWI4MzAtNjUwYi00MmFhLWI4MzItOWE5OWZmMjAxMGZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg3OTE3MzU@._V1_FMjpg_UY2137_.jpg">
In this drama we get introduced to Choi Joon-woong, a young jobseeker who has only saw failure when it comes to the insane amount of interviews he’s done. Our first scene with him shows him in another promising interview, as the other candidate doesn’t really have much to say, but when he steps outside and cheerfully tells his mother he has this one in the bag, he discovers the other candidate actually is a family member of the company and got the job over him. Depressed, he goes drinking with his best buddy, who’s studying to become a police officer, and while going home, he discovers a man on a bridge about to commit suicide. . <br><br>
He tries to stop the man and tells him to keep on living, here he met the grim reapers Ryeon and Ryung-gu for the first time, not fan how they rescue people, Joon-woong ended up arguing with them but thing went wrong.  In the process of saving him from jumping, he ends up going overboard with the guy. Joon-woong ends up in a coma because of it and the odds don’t look good. Considering what happened there as they mistake, the grim reapers in charge of the small team called “Risk Management team” that tries to stop suicidal people from killing themselves, giving a purpose for those who see no hope anymore, take him with them to the head of the afterlife company, Jumadeung, who tells Joon-woong that if he works for them for six months effectively, they will allow him back into his body and the chance to live. . <br><br>
The added perk of taking this contract is that he will get whatever job he wants. He naturally accepts, and is assigned to join the suicide unit with Ryeon and Ryung-gu. At first, he seems like dead weight, trying to get things done in a way that isn’t effective for them as a unit, but as time goes on, they warm up to him and his methods. . <br><br>
The different episodes focus on someone different who has become suicidal. There’s a screenwriter who has been confronted by her now successful high school bully, an anorexic cosmetic worker who sees no purpose in living, and a Korean War veteran who is about to die the next day but still finds no reason to keep on living.  . <br><br>
Ryeon’s storyline also is another big one. The antagonistic force in her afterlife is grim reaper leader Park Joong-il, who has a vendetta against anyone who tries to commit suicide. As it turns out, Ryeon was his wife in his past life, and when she was captured by Japanese invaders and defiled, he saved her.  The village ostracized her as she had lost her honor in the process, and she simply couldn’t handle it after a certain point. She killed herself and went to hell considering suicide as a crime, and Joong-il, after living several lives, asked for that part of his life to be sealed. He doesn’t realize the extent of their past together. Choi Joon-woong main mission was to heal both of them from the past, leaving them with no regrets. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
This drama definitely has a strong message. It's all about empathy, and how much we can learn from the people we help. Each character they rescue teaches them something new, and let's be honest, get ready for some tears! It tackles real struggles that people go through, and seeing the characters grow is heartwarming. <br><br>
But it's not all doom and gloom. There's a hopeful message here, about finding the light even when things are tough and never giving up the fight. The characters are what really make the drama interesting. Goo Ryeon, the leader, seems cold at first, but you slowly see a softer side to her. Lim Ryoong another team member, provides a grumpy yet surprisingly caring counterpoint, and Choi Joon-woong, the newbie, is hilarious as an outsider thrown into this crazy world. Their interactions are a highlight, and it's awesome to see them develop alongside the cases they solve. <br><br>
Overall, Tomorrow get 10 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

Moving, takes viewers on a thrilling ride into the world of teenagers harboring extraordinary secrets. Kim Bong-seok, the seemingly ordinary student, possesses the awe-inspiring ability to fly, a power he guards fiercely. His life takes an unexpected turn with the arrival of Jang Hui-soo, a new transfer student who instantly captures his attention. However, Hui-soo holds her own secret: exceptional athleticism and the ability to heal from seemingly fatal injuries with superhuman speed. Rounding out the trio is Lee Gang-Hoon, a young man with uncanny strength and speed, who like his counterparts, strives to keep his abilities hidden. <br><br>
Beneath the surface of their seemingly normal high school lives lies a constant struggle for the teenagers and their parents. The parents, aware of their children's extraordinary abilities, live with the constant fear of them being exploited by those seeking to utilize their powers for nefarious purposes. This ever-present threat creates a tense atmosphere, with the parents working tirelessly to shield their children and ensure their safety. <br><br>
As the story unfolds, the teenagers' secrets unravel, each facing challenges that force them to confront the potential dangers of their abilities. Bong-seok's budding friendship with Hui-soo puts him at risk of exposure, forcing him to acknowledge the potential consequences of his power. In a moment of vulnerability, Hui-soo reveals her own secret to Bong-seok, solidifying their bond and highlighting the shared burden they carry. <br><br>
Moving transcends the typical high school drama setting, propelling the teenagers into a world far more dangerous than they could have ever imagined. Their lives become intertwined with gangsters, NIS agents, and even North Korean spies, introducing a thrilling element of international intrigue that raises the stakes considerably. The arrival of North Korean agents seeking specific files hidden within Jeongwon High School, the teenagers' school, adds another layer of complexity to the plot. This international dimension intensifies the drama, as the teenagers find themselves caught in the crossfire between opposing forces. <br><br>

Choi Il-hwan, the seemingly ordinary teacher at Jeongwon High School, is unmasked as a former Special Forces soldier, a revelation that adds another layer of intrigue and hints at a past shrouded in secrets and potential danger.

Initially hesitant to openly utilize their powers, the teenagers are forced to fight back to protect themselves and their loved ones, facing difficult choices that challenge their morals and sense of responsibility. <br><br>
Throughout the narrative, hidden agendas and motivations are slowly revealed, blurring the lines between friend and foe. This constant uncertainty keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats, as they attempt to discern who they can truly trust amidst the web of deceit.
Despite the constant danger and thrilling action, Moving doesn't lose sight of the importance of empathy and family. The teenagers learn to rely on each other and their parents, forming an unbreakable bond that serves as a source of strength and solace as they navigate the challenges they face. This emphasis on emotional connection adds depth and heart to the narrative, reminding viewers of the importance of support and compassion amidst the chaos. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
Man, I gotta say, "Moving" had a cool concept – teenagers with superpowers, that's pretty darn ambitious! But honestly, the show dragged on way too much. It felt like forever between things happening. And some of the lines? They were just kind of pointless, didn't really add anything to the scene. Their acting was kinda flat, didn't really pull any emotions out of me. And the plot itself? Confusing at times. It was hard to follow how everything connected, like pieces of a puzzle that didn't quite fit. <br><br>
Even the characters themselves felt kinda passive, just letting things happen to them instead of taking charge. Sure, there were some decent action scenes, but the dialogue and overall story could have been way better. Just having superpowers isn't enough to keep me hooked. It felt like they should have fleshed out the whole premise a lot more before actually making the show. Honestly, the whole thing was pretty boring. The beginning was especially confusing, and the story ideas felt like a total mess. The only saving grace was seeing how the parents were trying to protect their kids, and learning about their pasts. But the kids' storyline? Complete and utter chaos. <br><br>
Overall, Moving get 4 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
One of the best K-drama I've ever watched, the episodes are literally breathtaking & full of suspense. I must admit that the cast acting was mind blowing, they played their character perfectly. At first, I thought the story is going to be boring, too dark and cliché, but NO. Not at all. This drama will make you join the main characters on guessing who is the bad guy behind his misery. It has mistery that will not be solved in only one or two episodes but the whole season. But, it doesn't worry me because the story keeps getting interesting after every episodes. <br><br>
Overall, Big Mouth get 10 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

"True Beauty" immerses viewers in the world of Lim Ju-kyung, a high school student whose life is deeply impacted by her insecurities regarding her appearance. Enduring bullying and discrimination, Ju-kyung feels the weight of societal beauty standards bearing down on her. Determined to break free from this oppressive mold, she turns to makeup tutorials as her gateway to transformation.
Through the magic of cosmetics, Ju-kyung metamorphoses into a breathtaking "goddess," a stark contrast to her former self. As she steps into her new school, adorned with confidence and beauty, her classmates are captivated by her radiant aura. However, behind this facade lies a complex reality - Ju-kyung's newfound popularity hinges on a delicate balance between her school persona and her true self. <br><br>
Caught amidst the swirl of teenage emotions and burgeoning romance, Ju-kyung finds herself entangled in a captivating love triangle. On one side stands Lee Su-ho, the enigmatic yet kind-hearted classmate who sees beyond her outward appearance. On the other, Han Seo-jun, the rebellious and charming student who offers a different form of companionship. As Ju-kyung navigates the delicate dance of affection and friendship, the dynamics of her relationships with both boys unravel, revealing layers of vulnerability and authenticity. <br><br>
However, "True Beauty" transcends the confines of typical romantic dramas by weaving a rich tapestry of female camaraderie. Ju-kyung finds refuge and solidarity in her friendships with classmates, showcasing the strength and resilience fostered through sisterhood. These bonds provide a sanctuary amidst the turbulence of adolescent life, underscoring the significance of supportive relationships in navigating personal growth and self-discovery. <br><br>
As the series progresses, it undergoes a profound transformation of its own, shifting its focus from external beauty to the exploration of inner strength and self-acceptance. Ju-kyung's journey becomes a testament to the power of embracing one's true identity, beyond the constraints of societal expectations.

<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
"True Beauty" is a visually captivating drama that offers a lighthearted escape. The makeup transformations are undeniably fun and creative, adding a unique layer to the story. However, the narrative can sometimes feel predictable, relying on familiar tropes within the rom-com genre. While the drama touches upon important themes like self-esteem and the pressures of societal beauty standards, I found myself wishing it delved deeper into these complexities. The surface-level exploration, while relatable, leaves room for a more profound impact. Despite this, "True Beauty" shines as a sweet and entertaining series. It delivers a positive message about self-acceptance, reminding viewers of the importance of inner beauty. <br><br>
Overall, True Beauty get 9 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZhMWJmZDUtZmM1NC00NmNhLThlM2MtYWU2ZmRkYWEwMmJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjI4NDY5ODM@._V1_.jpg">
"Branding in Seongsu" intricately weaves a tale of unexpected connections and profound transformations. At its heart are Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho, two individuals whose paths diverge dramatically following an unforeseen incident that leads to a miraculous body swap. <br><br>
Na Eon stands as the epitome of success within the bustling corridors of a Seongsu marketing agency. As the youngest leader of the marketing team, she is revered for her unmatched prowess in every project she undertakes, earning her the status of a legend in the industry. Yet, her unwavering dedication to her career has exacted a toll on her personal life, leaving behind a trail of fractured friendships and unfulfilled romantic aspirations. <br><br>
On the flip side, we encounter Eun Ho, the embodiment of youthful exuberance and spontaneity. Known for his endearing charm and perpetual zest for life, he embodies the 'YOLO' philosophy with fervor, embracing each moment with infectious enthusiasm. However, his carefree existence takes an unexpected turn when circumstances compel him to enter the competitive realm of the job market. <br><br>
Their worlds collide in a whirlwind of chaos when an accidental kiss triggers an inexplicable phenomenon: their souls swap bodies. This happened on the night that Na Eon was almost murdered after the chaos of her latest business with XU beauty. Overnight, Na Eon finds herself navigating the complexities of internships and the laid-back lifestyle she once dismissed, while Eun Ho grapples with the pressures of leadership and the relentless demands of the corporate sphere. <br><br>
Initially at odds due to their contrasting values and perspectives, the forced intimacy of their situation brings Na Eon and Eun Ho closer together. As they traverse the unfamiliar terrain of each other's lives, they develop a newfound understanding and appreciation for the struggles they once belittled. Amidst the chaos and confusion, a tender and burgeoning romantic connection blossoms, transcending the boundaries of their physical identities. At the same time, Na Eon was using Eun Ho body to her advantage to catch her killer with a better physic and strength. <br><br>
Yet, their journey is fraught with challenges both personal and professional. As they endeavor to reverse the enigmatic body swap, they confront their deepest insecurities and confront the intricacies of human relationships. Through their shared ordeal, they embark on a profound exploration of identity, empathy, and the transformative power of love. <br><br>
That what we thought until we learn Eun Ho isn’t who we thought is. Eun Ho’s journey takes a darker turn as he delves into the past to seek justice for his late girlfriend, Nam-gung Da-Eun. Eun Ho, driven by grief and a thirst for justice, mistakenly believes that Kang Na Eon is responsible for his girlfriend’s death. This belief stems from a discovery that five years prior, Na Eon allegedly appropriated a proposal from a project crucial to Eun Ho and his girlfriend, Nam-gung Da-Eun. Convinced that Na Eon’s actions led to tragic consequences, Eun Ho embarks on a path of revenge, planning to make her pay for the perceived wrongdoing. <br><br>
Upon learning the truth, Eun Ho is faced with the reality of his actions and the misdirected anger he harbored towards Na Eon. This leads to a heartfelt apology from Eun Ho, as he grapples with his feelings of guilt and remorse for having wrongly accused her. She actually apologized for the event that happened 5years ago but the hard disk that she left was stolen by the higher of her company to be used against her later on. During this emotional exchange, Eun Ho also comes to terms with the growing feelings he has developed for Na Eon from thinking she was a cold person to a warm person but with a complex personality, adding a layer of complexity to their relationship. <br><br>
We learn at the end of the serie, that the killer was actually Min Hee-jung, Ne Eon boss and supporter, but also her actual killer. Eun Ho, overwhelmed by the words of Min Hee-jung who blamed him for the loss of his first love, Nam-gung Da-Eun, decides to take a break from his job and his relationship with Kang Na Eon. Stricken with grief, he leaves, promising to return once he has come to terms with the situation. After a year, he came back to Na Eon and lived a happy love life. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
The story is so heart-warming. And seeing Lomon take on a new type of role just gave me goosebumps! So proud of how he managed to portray Eun Ho seamlessly, even when acting as Na Eon. Eun Ho portrayed a happy-go-lucky person, but lived with pain and revenge. And he became the plot twist of the drama. Na Eon portrayed as strong and brave, but lived with pain and regrets. When they come to terms with their sufferings, it gets so emotional. And the ending was so lovely! <br><br>
The acting of the entire cast was really good. The storyline is described as very interesting and engaging. The soul-switching element is well-executed and doesn’t feel out of place. The drama get better with every episode. <br>
Overall, Branding is Seongsu get 10 out of 10 stars. <br><br>

<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://media.themoviedb.org/t/p/w500/3Fh0F9tlq1ly788RnZRPoreAhSY.jpg">
Mo Nan-hee is a university student struggling with low self-esteem due to her perceived lack of attractiveness. Her life takes a turn when she receives a magical ring from her mother. This ring has the peculiar ability to make its wearer appear as the "ideal type" of the person who puts it on. <br><br>
Nan-hee sets her sights on Park Se-gun, a popular and shallow model who only dates beautiful girls. Armed with the magic ring's power, Nan-hee transforms into his ideal woman. However, her newfound beauty comes with a complication, Se-gun is oblivious to the real Nan-hee beneath the ring's illusion. This sets the stage for a comedic and slightly confusing love triangle. <br><br>
While Se-gun falls head over heels for Nan-hee's transformed appearance, the ring can't change her personality. Her social awkwardness and genuine nature often clash with Se-gun's superficial personality. This creates a humorous dynamic as Nan-hee tries to navigate the situation. <br><br>

In my opinion "Queen of the Ring" is a lighthearted watch with a refreshing premise. Kim Seul-gi delivers a charming performance as the awkward yet endearing Nan-hee. The humor is light and situational, often stemming from Nan-hee's struggles to maintain her facade while navigating the world as Se-gun's "ideal type." <br><br>
The drama is predictable but the serie is a cute and quick watch that will make u laugh. While the plot might not be groundbreaking, it offers a heartwarming message about inner beauty and the importance of being yourself. <br><br>

<h3>"I’ll make King Hotel a place without fake smiles."</h3>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
<img class="srcs" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE5ZDJmZGItMDRkNi00YjAxLTliYjQtYjBjZjk4Yjk4NjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzOTcyODA5._V1_.jpg">
Gu Won, heir to the sprawling King Group has a unique problem, he can't stand fake smiles because he was traumatized by them when his mom left him at young age. In his world of wealth and privilege, everyone seems to have a hidden agenda masked by greed. <br><br>
Meanwhile Cheon Sa Rang is a ray of sunshine working at the opulent King Hotel. Unlike the calculated smiles Gu Won encounters daily, Sa Rang's smile is as genuine as it is warm, a beacon of authenticity in a sea of pretense. She spent most her time having fun with her close best friend Oh Pyeong-Hwa and Gang Da-Eul, while also helping her grandma who took care of her after the death of her parents. <br><br>
The King Hotel holds a special place in Sa Rang's heart, filled with cherished memories from her childhood. However, navigating the hotel's complex social hierarchy proves challenging. Some colleagues view her with suspicion, their smiles hiding hidden motives. Meanwhile, Gu Won's life takes a dramatic turn as he becomes embroiled in a bitter family conflict with his older sister for control of the King Group. <br><br>
Their paths converge at King the Land, a luxurious VIP lounge reserved for the King Group's elite clientele. Despite Gu Won's initial wariness, a spark ignites between them. Their interactions are a delightful dance, filled with moments that evoke genuine smiles and heartwarming connections. As they spend more time together, their feelings deepen, offering a welcome respite from the complexities swirling around them. <br><br>
However, their budding romance faces formidable obstacles. The family conflict throws Gu Won's life into disarray, forcing him to confront his loyalty and responsibilities. Sa Rang, despite her positive attitude, encounters prejudice from some colleagues who view her with skepticism. Undeterred, she tackles these challenges with grace and resilience, her genuine smile remaining a constant source of strength. <br><br>
When their relationship becomes public knowledge, shockwaves ripple through high society. Sa Rang, known for her genuine smile and humble background, suddenly finds herself thrust into the spotlight. The media frenzy intensifies as rumors swirl about the nature of their connection. Is it love, or a calculated move by Sa Rang to climb the social ladder? When history of the king group empire repeat itself? Father like son? The public speculates endlessly.
Sa Rang faces immense pressure. She is no longer just an employee at the King Hotel; she is now the subject of relentless media scrutiny and gossip. Her sincerity and authenticity are questioned, leaving her grappling with self-doubt and anxiety, not mentioning, she was sent to king tourist by Gu Won’s father, in a country away from Seoul to disappear from the spotlight and probably forget about Gu Won and they love while he was in a business trip. <br><br>
Against all odds, Sa Rang and Gu Won refuses to be a pawn in Hwa-ran’s game. Sa Rang genuine smile remains a defiant symbol of hope as she tackles the challenges thrown her way. She proves her worth at the King Hotel through dedication and hard work, earning the respect and admiration of staff and guests alike, keeping they love intact and forever. After Gu Won’s mother came back from the shadow, they were finaly consoled and freed from the past and the years that separated them. His mother played a huge role in the serie; she remind his father to let him live his life like he wish not step in and ruin it like his father did to both of them. <br><br>.
The story doesn't end there. Sa Rang, while deeply in love with Gu Won, feels unfulfilled in her work at King the Land. Yearning for a deeper purpose, she decides to pursue her own dream of running a small, cozy hotel. Gu Won, ever supportive, postpones his proposal plans and wholeheartedly encourages her ambitions. With her grandmother's financial backing, Sa Rang finds a perfect location and begins decorating it, determined to create a space that reflects her warmth and hospitality. Her smile remains radiant as she takes this bold step towards her dream. At the end, after Sa Rang's courage and Gu Won's unwavering support, they finaly get married at the end.  <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
King the Land has become one of my all-time favorite romantic comedies! The plot is clean and easy to follow, and the characters are both well-written and superbly acted. It's a truly heartwarming drama that will leave you with a smile. The chemistry between Goo Won and Sa Rang is undeniable, making their love story even more captivating. From their initial cute encounters filled with genuine smiles to their unwavering loyalty through societal pressures and judgments, I felt glued to screen. Sa Rang's positive attitude, resilience, and genuine smile won my heart, every time I see her smiling I can’t smile, it affected my overall mood. <br><br>
While some might find the story predictable with a happily-ever-after ending, what truly shines in King the Land is the development of its characters. They feel real and relatable, and the drama avoids unnecessary breakups. The light and fun tone, particularly Gu Won's clumsiness in love, offers a refreshing escape from heavier dramas. <br><br>
