<h3>“My life feels as if it’s shrouded in mist. Who is a friend and who is a foe? Or is everyone around me a foe? I can’t tell.”</h3>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
Do Do-hee, a busy CEO who works all the time, meets Gu Won, a charming but arrogant demon who grants wishes for people's souls. Their first meeting was totally accidental. Madame Ju, the chairwoman, set Do-Hee up on a blind date with someone else, but she ended up at the wrong restaurant and met Gu Won instead. This chance meeting changes everything for both of them. <br><br>
After their meeting, Do-Hee faces trouble with her adopted family, including a death threat from her brother. Before the accident, upset, she goes to the beach to remember her real parents who died that day, on her birthday but when she was heading to leavet, the taxi driver tries to abduct her! She tried to escapes and runs away. <br><br>
While being chased, Gu Won offers Do-Hee a deal, but things go wrong, his power didn’t work which lead to both of them falling into the river where she ends up with his demon powers, leaving him weak and needing her help. This is a funny situation, as they try to switch their powers back. <br><br>
Forced to live together to protect her life against her enemies and regain his powers, Do-Hee and Gu Won fight all the time. She doesn't like that he's lazy, and he doesn't like that she controls everything. But as they spend more time together, they start to respect and even like each other. This "enemies to lovers" story is the best part, with lots of funny jokes and great chemistry between the actors. <br><br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
My Demon is a fun and interesting show with a new take on the usual demon story. Gu Won isn't a scary evil demon, he's more like a selfish jerk. The show mixes humor and heartwarming moments well. <br><br>
The plot is good with some surprises, exactly what a romantic comedy should be. There are hilarious scenes, like when Gu Won pushes Do-Hee in the river to try getting his powers back, or when they fight bad guys while dancing the tango. However, the writing gets messy towards the end. Gu Won is supposed to be immortal, but Do-Hee still tries to save him from a bullet even though he can't die. <br><br>
The show also confuses religious ideas. They show churches, the devil, and priests, but then talk about reincarnation, which isn't part of Christianity. They even show God as a woman who begs for money! The ending feels rushed because Do-Hee will eventually die of old age, while Gu Won lives forever. How can they have a love story if one of them dies? <br><br>
Overall, My Demon gets 3 out of 5 stars. <br>
The drama is light and fun watch for people who like fantasy romances with some comedy. But if you want a complex plot with deep characters, this show might not be for you. <br><br><br>

<h3>"I don’t need a prince to save me, I need an executioner to join the hunt."</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
Moon Dong-eun suffers horrific bullying in high school, including burns and sexual assault, which forces her to drop out. Years later, after careful planning and hard work, she exacts revenge on those who wronged her. Her meticulous schemes and manipulation of her tormentors are both chilling and captivating to watch. She avoids violence herself, cleverly setting things in motion for her adversaries to self-destruct. <br><br>
She meticulously plots revenge against her former bullies, now successful and seemingly happy. The story follows Dong-eun's dark and determined path as she weaves herself into the lives of her bullies and their children. <br><br>
But her revenge will not happen alone. She met Joo Yeo-jeong, a medical intern who meets Dong-eun while both are patients at the hospital where he works. Dong-eun is initially skeptical of Yeo-jeong's good intentions, given that he comes from a wealthy family and that his father was once in charge of the hospital where he now works, but sadly was murdered for no reasons which will affect the story later on. <br><br>
However, throughout the series, the two maintain their friendship by playing Go, a popular board game, in the park. The sad part about they relation is at first, Dong-eun is so preoccupied with her plan for vengeance that she doesn’t notice Yeo-jeong's affection for her. Nonetheless, their fates become increasingly intertwined as Dong-eun gets closer to exact her vengeance on those who wronged her, and Yeo-jeong is willing to go to any length to assist Dong-eun in completing her mission, becoming her executioner. <br><br>
Also she get help from Kang Hyeon-Nam, a housemaid, she is serving Dong-Eun's as spy, ally in seeking revenge against wealthy individuals. Enduring abuse from her husband, Lee Seok-Jae, she dreams of a better life for her daughter, Sun-A. Through her sacrifices and collaboration with Dong-Eun, Hyeon-Nam secures Sun-A's education but she had to be send and adopted in America for her safety. Despite facing numerous challenges, including abuse and loyalty tests, she exhibits bravery and unwavering loyalty to Dong-Eun. <br><br>
At the end Dong-eun grapples with the consequences of her actions. The line between victim and perpetrator blurs. Is she truly free, or has she become a monster herself? Meanwhile, the remaining bullies, battered but not broken, sense an opportunity. They unite, determined to expose Dong-eun's dark past and destroy her. A high-stakes game of manipulation ensues, with Dong-eun forced to confront not only her former tormentors but also the darkness within herself. <br><br>
This is why after she finished her revenge, she tries to commit suicide at the abandoned building where her friend died before her from her bully. But before she can jump off the building, Yeo-jung’s mom stops her and asks her to save her son, she begs Dong-eun not to kill herself because by doing so, she will be killing Yeo-jung as well. Yeo-jung’s mom knows what Dong-eun has been through but she doesn’t think death is the answer. She pleads with Dong-eun to save Yeo-jung from the hell he is going through. <br><br>
To find inner peace, Dong-eun decides to live and goes to the monk monastery where she spends six months. While there she strikes up a friendship with a judge and asks her if she can transfer Yeong-cheon to a stricter prison. After leaving and meeting with Yeo-jung, she offers to give him some lessons and promises to be his executioner. <br><br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
The drama embraces the idea of "revenge is a dish best served cold." It's undeniably satisfying to see Dong-eun orchestrate the downfall of those who hurt her. However, the series also explores the emotional toll of revenge and the moral ambiguity of Dong-eun's actions. <br><br>
"The Glory" focuses on the lasting effects of bullying and trauma, rather than romance, although her bond with Joo Yeo-jeong is undeniable, with both admitting their feelings. Dong-eun's inner struggles are portrayed realistically, making her a complex and understandable character. <br><br>
The series makes viewers confront the harsh realities of bullying and the difficulty of finding true healing. Moon Dong-eun's path to revenge starts alone, but she eventually builds a team by her side. <br><br>
Overall, The Glory gets 5 out of 5 stars. <br>
It's visually stunning and boasts a well-written script that keeps you guessing. This is a must-watch for fans of dark thrillers and revenge stories. <br><br>

<h3>"When Someone is sure about keeping a PROMISE when it's hardly possible, there's a good chance that it's a LIE"</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>

(Season 2 summary will be given out when the full season is release this summer) <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
"Sweet Home" is a thrilling watch for fans of horror and action. The suspenseful atmosphere keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the social commentary adds depth to the narrative. The serie explores themes of isolation, depression, and the will to survive. <br><br>
But there are moments that feel a little slow and distorted, it has some interesting characters and enough scary moments to keep you captivated. As for the characters and production design, they are terrific, and the feverishly imagined monsters are capable of delivering real chills and Evil Dead-style goofiness. <br><br>
The fight scenes between humans and monsters are intense and well-choreographed, particularly the escape through the vents. <br><br>
Overall, Sweet Home gets 4 out of 5 stars for season 1. <br>
The drama have a unique story and actions whicha offers more than just monster bashing, the emotions and feelings express by the residents keep you entertained. the serie show you the dark side of every person, the way they think for they own advantage to survive, and the result of they desires.It's a story about facing your fears, finding strength in community, and the resilience of the human spirit, even in the face of monstrous transformation. <br><br>

He's forced to move back home with his "bad mother," Young-Soon, and they embark on a journey of healing their fractured relationship. <br><br>
The drama cleverly blends humor with heartwarming moments. Young-Soon's brash and unconventional methods often clash with Kang-Ho's childlike innocence. Their bickering and interactions provide comedic relief, while their journey of rediscovering their bond tugs at the heartstrings. <br><br>

I find "The Good Bad Mother" is a charming and heartwarming drama with a unique concept. The drama tackles sensitive topics like family dysfunction and childhood neglect. <br><br>
The core narrative of a mother and son navigating a heartbreaking situation is heartwarming and emotional, it make me feel the feelings expressed during the show which most are saddest adn regrets. But the show blends humor with the heavier themes, creating a bittersweet but engaging experience which makes thing more interesting. <br><br>
Overall, The Good Bad Mother gets 4 out of 5 stars. <br>
It feel-good to have a drama that celebrates family bonds and the power of forgiveness, even though the events are a bit repetitive and boring. It is a charming and heartwarming drama with a unique concept which tackles sensitive topics like family dysfunction and childhood neglect with a touch of humor and love. <br><br>

<h3>"I think it is so unfair that we can't do anything about what our hearts want"</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
The serie start that in a futuristic world, everyone has the Love Alarm app installed. It alerts you if someone within a 10-meter radius likes you back, creating a culture of open crushes and public displays of affection (or rejection). <br><br>
We learn about Kim Jojo, a high school student who hides her past heartbreak by keeping her Love Alarm deactivated and Lee Sun-oh, a popular model who have feeling towards her, also we get introduced to Hwang Sun-young, Jojo's bubbly best friend, who met Kim Jojo during his work time and had feeling for her which adds another layer to the love triangle. <br><br>
In season 1 we get introduction to this unique world, where there is an interesting app called "Love Alarm" which let you know if someone have feeling towards you. The story follows three main characters: Kim Jojo, a high school student struggling with family issues; Hwang Sun-oh, a popular and wealthy student who falls for Jojo; and Lee Hye-young, Sun-oh's childhood friend who also develops feelings for Jojo. <br><br>
As their love triangle unfolds, the complications of the Love Alarm app and its impact on relationships become increasingly apparent. The season ends with Jojo deciding to break up with Sun-oh to protect him using a shield given to her by dev, also to pursue her own happiness, despite the interference of Love Alarm. <br><br>
Meanwhile In the second season, tensions rise as Jojo faces new challenges in her love life. She discovers that her cousin, who shares her appearance, is impersonating her online. Meanwhile, Sun-oh, who had left Korea, returns and tries to reconnect with Jojo. However, she has grown closer to Hye-young in his absence. As they navigate their complicated feelings, they also confront the darker side of the Love Alarm app, including its manipulation by those in power and its impact on society. <br><br>
The season ends with Jojo finally choosing between Sun-oh and Hye-young, she decide to stay with Hye-young and ring his love alarm using a spear by her old friend meanwhile his brother was against the idea and tried over his company. This season raises questions about whether true love can exist in a world where feelings are so easily displayed. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
First thing first, I can’t deny that the actors in this show are good, they nailed the emotions perfectly but the story is the weakest part of this show. It’s literally a show about an app that tells you who you like. I mean really... why would anyone listen to an app tell them who they love or not, but the idea was developed in the serie which I really like, it should that technology could lead to death, like the people who committed suicide because they love alarm didn’t ring or the woman who died because her love alarm ringed to her killer but it still absurd like why would anyone listen to an app about they love life. Should I also mention like damn girl, I wouldn't kiss a guy I met a minute ago and surprisingly fell inlove with hin the next day. <br><br> 
I won't go anymore into detail, but in my opinion the first season is phenomenal, especially the firts half of it is amazing, but the 2nd season and it was a huge disaster, the plot was a total mess. The direction it takes is nonsensical and it missed so many great chances, at some point the characters were very uninteresting, which create a sensation of void. I watched the last half of the 2nd season +5s every second, just to not waste even more of my time. Honestly, I wished that I only watched the first season and ended there. <br><br>
Overall, Love Alarm gets 3 out of 5 stars. <br>
It was an engaging drama that offers a fun and thought-provoking exploration of love in the digital age but it was repetitive and boring; every scene was almost the same and the issue is the same without any changes or solutions. But, the serie also exhibits how dependence on technologies can create further problems. It was good to see how the central characters were making efforts instead of solely relying on what "Love Alarm" app was suggesting.<br><br>

But didn’t expect that the CEO Yu Ji-hyuk of her company was also sent back in time after being involved in a car accident which lead to his death. He was sent back also in time to protect Kang Ji-won, and avoid all regrets for not being by her side; he was her father allowance. This time to avoid regrets, he protect her and confess his feeling which he wasn't able to do before time traveling. Yu Ji-hyuk, knew about the future so decided to offer his support and becomes entangled in her plan. This adds a heartwarming layer to the story, exploring the possibility of love after betrayal. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
In my opinion, this is incredibly well-written and well acted. It grabs your emotions and makes you invest in the characters. There's enough back story to explain things without it going off on to some uninteresting tangent. There is great chemistry between actors (not just the lead ones) and an amazing sense of anticipation. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, a twist comes in. Realistic twists, not some far-fetched thing to wrap up a side story. <br><br>
I find it interesting that Ji Won realizes that things that are supposed to happen, will happen and if not to her, then to someone else. Meaning, if she doesn't want certain things to happen to her, she needs to get those things to happen to someone else. This is certainly one way to keep things interesting, and create enough story for 16 episodes and avoid repetition of events <br><br>
It also raises the question, what will you do with your second chance if given one. It is best to take action and make decisions that you won't regret whatever challenges it may bring. The positive and assertive action taken by FL definitely influenced all the good people around her, most especially the ML who is normally seen as boring, though he has all the money and power anyone will ever have. Basically whatever you are or do, don't be anyone's doormat. <br><br>
Overall, Marry My Husband gets 3 and half out of 5 stars. <br>
The drama have a unique story, strong characters, and a touch of romance. The revenge plot is well-executed, and the time travel aspect adds a unique layer. While the premise is dark, the show cleverly blends humor and lighthearted moments, making it an entertaining watch.<br><br>

It turns out Yeon-joo's father can't control his creation. He's been trying to kill Kang Chul in the webtoon, which affects Yeon-joo’s real life by teleporting her into the webtoon. Yeon-joo keeps saving him, building up a connection. Kang Chul learns he's a comic book character and enters the real world, but his killer follows. <br><br>

Things got worse after bering him back to life, the killer starts murdering in the real world. So Yeon Joo and Kang Chul decide to reverse time before they met to avoid this mess but didn’t both know that the killer already have knowledge about the real world before this moment, so they sacrifice did nothing but hurting they feeling. <br><br>

<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
This drama made me attached to it from the first episode, because it is not a typical love story wherein both leads are humans or both leads are from the same world or time. It is a story about a webtoon character and a real human being. <br><br>
I am very much satisfied with the illustrations presented in the drama. If only it was a real manhwa, I would have both all the books of it. The manhwa characters really look similar with the original casts which makes also it really interesting. <br><br>
The acting is absolutely phenomenal and I love everything about this drama! The concept and plot is original and unique, and the actors have great chemistry. With each episode you keep getting pulled in by the story to the point you cannot wait for the next episode to come out. It holds a perfect blend of humor, action, suspense/mystery, drama, and love! <br><br>
Overall, W: Two World gets 4 out of 5 stars. <br>
This drama is a masterpiece! The drama is a guessing game all over and the plot twists are so well put and so mind-blowing. It makes you really realise what a real-life and real ending is while being a fantasy drama in itself. The plot gave me so much closure and feelings that I, for the first time, wish to re-watch it as my first watch. No words, legit no words! Everyone acted so well. <br><br>

<h3>"If there's really such a thing as soulmates, I think she was mine."</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
The serie start with Park Hoon’s father framed and sent to North Korea to cure its leader. He was purposely sent there by Myungwoo University Hospital chairman to avoid a law suit against the hospital for malpratice. But to make sure that the father stays there, he son was sent alongside with him. There he grew and became a famous doctor for his exceptional skills in thoracic surgery. <br><br>
However, his world crumbles when his father, a respected doctor himself, is framed for malpractice and murdered and his girlfriend and future wife to which he propose went to a concentration camp. This devastating event becomes a turning point in Hoon's life, igniting a burning desire for escaping and revenge against those responsible. <br><br>
Desperate to escape the corrupt system and protect his ill girlfriend, Hoon flees North Korea, but fate deals another cruel blow. During their harrowing escape attempt, his girlfriend seems to tragically die from a bridge, leaving him utterly alone and consumed by grief. He arrives in South Korea under the name of Do In-soo, a talented surgeon facing constant suspicion due to his origins. <br><br>
While working and living his live as a water delivery, he encounter Han Seung-hee, who is now a resident doctor, whom he believed died during the escape. Their connection reignites, offering a glimmer of solace amidst the darkness. However, a cruel twist of fate reveals a tangled web of secrets. Seung-hee is now working with the North Korean soldiers and spies that want Hoon dead as revenge for escaping and leading them into trouble. <br><br>
Determined to expose the corrupt minister who'd been pulling the strings since the beginning, Park Hoon and Seung-hee planned to reveal the truth to the president. The minister, who'd been manipulating the president into an unconscious state to seize power, would finally be held accountable. However, in a shocking turn of events, the president betrayed them. While the minister escaped punishment, he wasn't spared entirely. <br><br>
The spy he hired with Han Seung-hee to eliminate Park Hoon got revenge for their betrayal and attempted to kill the minister.

This time, Park Hoon refused to let Seung-hee sacrifice herself, and it was implied that both might have perished. Thankfully, the drama's ending revealed they were still alive. <br><br><h4> My Opinion:</h4>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
I loved the surgery scenes, they were well acted and filmed. The most beautiful relationship in the world is shown between the character Dr. Park and Dr. Oh. Their relationship is so pure , real and is far away for many people to understand it. Their relationship is free from all the societal bonding , it's neither marriage bond or friendship bond or love bond , they are just free souls, unbound but always together & are there for each other, always teasing each other, make you cry and laugh both at extreme. <br><br>
Dr. Stranger isn't just about dramatic reveals and forbidden love. It dives headfirst into the world of high-stakes surgery. Each operating room scene becomes a gripping spectacle, showcasing the intricate procedures and immense pressure faced by medical professionals. <br><br>
Overall, Dr Stranger gets 3 and half out of 5 stars. <br>
Dr. Stranger transcends dramatic reveals and forbidden love. It dives headfirst into the world of high-stakes surgery, transforming each operating room scene into a gripping spectacle.  The intricate procedures and immense pressure faced by medical professionals are brought to life in a way that is both thrilling and thought-provoking.  While the drama boasts a unique story, some viewers might find it repetitive due to its length.  However, Dr. Stranger doesn't shy away from exploring complex themes like revenge, redemption, and the human spirit's ability to endure even in the face of immense loss, and the difference of the concept of a doctor between both North and South Korea. <br><br>

<h3>If you don’t feel happy yourself, what’s the point of saving others?</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
In this drama we get introduced to Choi Joon-woong, a young jobseeker who has only saw failure when it comes to the insane amount of interviews he’s done. Our first scene with him shows him in another promising interview, as the other candidate doesn’t really have much to say, but when he steps outside and cheerfully tells his mother he has this one in the bag, he discovers the other candidate actually is a family member of the company and got the job over him. Depressed, he goes drinking with his best buddy, who’s studying to become a police officer, and while going home, he discovers a man on a bridge about to commit suicide. . <br><br>
He tries to stop the man and tells him to keep on living, here he met the grim reapers Ryeon and Ryung-gu for the first time, not fan how they rescue people, Joon-woong ended up arguing with them but thing went wrong.  In the process of saving him from jumping, he ends up going overboard with the guy. Joon-woong ends up in a coma because of it and the odds don’t look good. Considering what happened there as they mistake, the grim reapers in charge of the small team called “Risk Management team” that tries to stop suicidal people from killing themselves, giving a purpose for those who see no hope anymore, take him with them to the head of the afterlife company, Jumadeung, who tells Joon-woong that if he works for them for six months effectively, they will allow him back into his body and the chance to live. . <br><br>
The added perk of taking this contract is that he will get whatever job he wants. He naturally accepts, and is assigned to join the suicide unit with Ryeon and Ryung-gu. At first, he seems like dead weight, trying to get things done in a way that isn’t effective for them as a unit, but as time goes on, they warm up to him and his methods. . <br><br>
The different episodes focus on someone different who has become suicidal. There’s a screenwriter who has been confronted by her now successful high school bully, an anorexic cosmetic worker who sees no purpose in living, and a Korean War veteran who is about to die the next day but still finds no reason to keep on living.  . <br><br>
Ryeon’s storyline also is another big one. The antagonistic force in her afterlife is grim reaper leader Park Joong-il, who has a vendetta against anyone who tries to commit suicide. As it turns out, Ryeon was his wife in his past life, and when she was captured by Japanese invaders and defiled, he saved her.  The village ostracized her as she had lost her honor in the process, and she simply couldn’t handle it after a certain point. She killed herself and went to hell considering suicide as a crime, and Joong-il, after living several lives, asked for that part of his life to be sealed. He doesn’t realize the extent of their past together. Choi Joon-woong main mission was to heal both of them from the past, leaving them with no regrets. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
You should be prepared for tears! The show deals with relatable struggles and the characters' growth can be heartwarming. The drama offers a hopeful message, it isn't just about the darkness; it's about finding the light and the will to keep living and keep fighting, even when things feel bleak. <br><br>
The mix of characters make thing more interesting for the drama, starting with Goo Ryeon, the team leader, who comes across as cold and detached at first but gradually reveals a well of empathy. Lim Ryoong-gu, another team member, provides a grumpy yet surprisingly caring counterpoint. Then there's Choi Joon-woong, the human newbie who stumbles into this world by accident, his outsider perspective adds a layer of humor which allow us to burst into tears or laughs. The dynamic between these characters is a highlight, and their growth throughout the series is as compelling as the cases they tackle. <br><br>
Overall, Tomorrow get 5 out of 5 stars. <br>
I think this is a good concept overall, and there’s a lot to learn from the drama like these about empathy. I think there is something we learn from all of the characters throughout the show which they rescue. <br><br>

<h3>“I hate who I am. I don’t like how I feel about myself.”</h3> <br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
The drama features a group of teenagers with extraordinary inherited powers, each with their own unique abilities: Jang Ju-won, a former gangster turned agent with healing abilities and superhuman strength; Lee Mi-hyun, a mother with heightened senses and a former intelligence analyst; Kim Doo-sik, a father who can fly and a former black ops agent; Jeon Gye-do, a theater actor turned bus driver with the power to generate electricity; Kim Bong Seok, who possesses the ability of flight; Jang Hee Soo, known for her exceptional athleticism and rapid injury recovery; and Lee Gang Hoon, who wields uncanny strength and speed. <br><br>
Their parents, former agents with superpowers themselves, tirelessly work to protect their children from exploitation by external forces. Having once worked for the government, they vanished after uncovering its dubious schemes and now must navigate the dangers posed by the very organization they once served. <br><br>
While the series falls within the thriller and mystery genres, it primarily focuses on the theme of parental love and sacrifice. Through elaborate flashbacks, the story illustrates the lengths to which the protagonists will go to safeguard their loved ones. It also suggests that the teenagers' generation may be the first to exhibit these powers, catching agencies off guard. <br><br>
Conflicts arise from the parents' past actions, such as sabotaging missions to save innocents or refusing orders against their conscience. These actions lead to a life on the run and a constant fight for survival, as they navigate a delicate balance between secrecy and protection in their efforts to shield their children. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
The concept of this show is very ambitious, however the pace of the show is very very slow and some of the dialogue doesn't really add much to the scenes also many of the main characters don't have a lot of range and fail to stir any emotions through their acting, very flat acting with not as much feeling as there should be. Also it can be hard to understand the plot at times and how certain things are connected to each other. They show many of the characters as passive beings in their own lives not doing anything about their own circumstances. Some good action scenes but dialogue and plot of the show could be a lot better the fact that it's about them having super human abilities is not enough to grip me I think they should have worked more on the premise of the show before bringing it up the screen. <br><br>
Overall, Moving get 2 and half out of 5 stars. <br>
The drama is very boring, the events happening are really confusing at the beginning, the story ideas are a mess. The only positive side of this story, is how the parents are trying to protect they children, and the past of they parents. The kids story is a total mess. <br><br>

<h3>“We promised not to cross the line.”</h3> <br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
The drama unfolds with Shin Ha-ri, who is single and works for a company. She has a crush on a male friend for a long time, only to find out he has a girlfriend. Feeling dejected, she meets her friend Jin Young-seo, a chaebol’s daughter, who asks Ha-ri to take her place on a blind date. The twist comes when Ha-ri’s blind date is none other than Kang Tae-moo, the CEO of her company. <br><br>
Kang Tae-moo is a workaholic CEO whose grandfather, the chairman of the parent company, pressures him into blind dates to find a marriage partner. To escape this, Tae-moo decides to marry the next woman he meets on a blind date, who happens to be Ha-ri, disguised as Jin Young-seo. <br><br>
After the blind date, Tae-moo, unaware of Ha-ri’s real identity, asks her to marry him. Ha-ri, caught in the situation, agrees to pretend to be Tae-moo’s fiancée in exchange for money to help her family. This leads to a series of comedic yet touching moments as Ha-ri juggles her dual identity. <br><br>
As the story progresses, Ha-ri’s fake identity is revealed, but her employment status remains a secret. The drama continues with Tae-moo and Ha-ri navigating their relationship, both pretending to be unaware of each other’s true identities. Meanwhile, the real Jin Young-seo starts a romantic relationship with Tae-moo’s secretary, Cha Sung-hoon, adding another layer of romance and comedy to the plot. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
Everything from character development, makeup, typical clichés, romance, and the comedic scenes are exaggerated to such a degree that you cannot help yourself from laughing out loud. The show is pure entertainment and sometimes it makes you wonder whether it takes itself seriously. The smooth transition between plot development and outrageously funny scenes is nothing short of brilliant. <br><br>
The chemistry between the couples is one of the show's strongest points. You can clearly tell they are extremely comfortable in each other's presence. The portrayal of both a conservative and libertine couple is also well done with ample screen time to develop both relationships. <br><br>
Overall, Business Proposal get 5 out of 5 stars. <br>
I love this drama! I think it is one of the funniest K-dramas I have watched so far. After watching so many serious dramas with action and mind boggling plot twists, I was in the mood for something light hearted and stumbled across this on netflix. If you are looking for something less serious and want to laugh this is the one to watch.

<h3>You Know my fatal AURA!</h3> <br>
<h3>You Know my fatal AURA!</h3> <br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
The drama is about the Vice Chairman of Yumyung Group, a large corporation, Lee Young Joon. He is known to be very picky and also slightly narcissistic. His secretary, Kim Mi has been with him for 9 years in which she’s had to answer to his every demand. Although she started out awkward, she has now become the person Young Joon depends on the most since she knows all the ins and outs and doesn’t even have to be asked for certain tasks anymore since it’s all become a habitual routine for her. And then, out of the blue, Secretary Kim suddenly announces that she’d like to resign. Completely thrown off, Young Joon starts looking for reasons that might be the cause of this decision and he decides it must be because she likes him and cannot continue to work besides him anymore because of her feelings. <br><br>
This is how the story starts, and in this phase we are led to think that this is just a clueless arrogant Vice Chairman that wants to keep his trusted Secretary by his side no matter what. But that wasn’t the case. Lee Young-Joon gets anxious and tries to figure out why Kim suddenly wants to leave. Kim revealed that she wanted to get married, so he told her, he would allow her to marry him, which she took lighty as a joke. <br><br>
In this narrative, the Chairman makes persistent efforts to win over Kim, ranging from offering to date her to orchestrating romantic outings like a trip to an amusement park. Despite his gestures, Kim initially rebuffs him, insisting he's not her type, which incites his bitterness. However, their dynamic shifts when it's revealed that his actions were part of a grand romantic plan. <br><br>
Meanwhile, the Chairman's relationship with his estranged brother, Morpheus, adds complexity to the story. Their reunion sparks tensions, particularly when Kim unwittingly suggests inviting Morpheus to contribute to a hotel opening, unaware of the family feud. After a heated argument between the brothers, Kim finds herself playing mediator, nursing the Chairman's wounds after the altercation. <br><br>
As Kim and Morpheus delve into their shared past, seeking to unlock memories of a childhood kidnapping, the Chairman grows increasingly agitated by their closeness. Despite his jealousy, he finds solace in comforting Kim during moments of distress, hinting at a deeper connection tied to their shared past. The revelation that it was actually the Chairman, not Morpheus, who was kidnapped as a child adds another layer of intrigue to their relationship. While Kim grapples with resurfacing memories, the Chairman struggles with the weight of his suppressed past and his growing feelings for her. <br><br>
Their romance blossoms amidst the challenges of secrecy and professional decorum, with Kim's replacement, Ji Ah, stumbling upon their clandestine relationship. However, as rumors swirl within the company, Kim and the Chairman face mounting pressure to keep their romance under wraps. Despite their best efforts, their relationship becomes public knowledge, leading to further complications. Amidst wedding preparations, they navigate disagreements and jealousy, ultimately reaffirming their commitment to each other in a proposal and a wedding. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
I personally find the drama a truely Couple-Oriented Plot. Unlike many romance stories which focus on the complications of a love triangle, this one kept its focus firmly on the main pair, despite the potential for a triangle. Additionally, it realistically highlighted many of the struggles a normal couple would face in developing a new relationship, but kept the contrived angst to a refreshing minimum with actual communication. <br><br>
I find the drama is filled with moments of tension, humor, and romance, as Young-joon and Mi-so’s relationship evolves from a professional one to something much more personal. They must learn to balance their newfound feelings with their roles at the company, all while dealing with family issues and the repercussions of their past. <br><br>
Overall, Business Proposal get 5 out of 5 stars. <br>
I find this drama one of the best romantic comedies with a dash of drama that I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's funny, romantic af and the chemistry between the leads is off the charts. <br><br>

<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
One of the best K-drama I've ever watched, the episodes are literally breathtaking & full of suspense. I must admit cast acting was mind blowing, they played their character perfectly. At first, I thought the story is going to be boring, too dark and cliché, but NO. Not at all. This drama will make you join the main characters on guessing who is the bad guy behind his misery. It has mistery that will not be solved in only one or two episodes but the whole season. But, it doesn't worry me because the story keeps getting interesting after every episodes. <br><br>
Overall, Big Mouth get 5 out of 5 stars. <br>
The drama is suspenseful with a unique premise, the story is unique and not repetitive, and every scene have it twists. It is a thrilling legal drama that will keep you hooked with its suspenseful plot, complex characters, and the ever-present question: Who is the real Big Mouth? <br><br>

<h3>"Someone told me, that crying cleanse the heart. That is alright to cry sometimes."</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
"True Beauty" immerses viewers in the world of Lim Ju-kyung, a high school student whose life is deeply impacted by her insecurities regarding her appearance. Enduring bullying and discrimination, Ju-kyung feels the weight of societal beauty standards bearing down on her. Determined to break free from this oppressive mold, she turns to makeup tutorials as her gateway to transformation.
Through the magic of cosmetics, Ju-kyung metamorphoses into a breathtaking "goddess," a stark contrast to her former self. As she steps into her new school, adorned with confidence and beauty, her classmates are captivated by her radiant aura. However, behind this facade lies a complex reality - Ju-kyung's newfound popularity hinges on a delicate balance between her school persona and her true self. <br><br>
Caught amidst the swirl of teenage emotions and burgeoning romance, Ju-kyung finds herself entangled in a captivating love triangle. On one side stands Lee Su-ho, the enigmatic yet kind-hearted classmate who sees beyond her outward appearance. On the other, Han Seo-jun, the rebellious and charming student who offers a different form of companionship. As Ju-kyung navigates the delicate dance of affection and friendship, the dynamics of her relationships with both boys unravel, revealing layers of vulnerability and authenticity. <br><br>

<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
In my Opinion "True Beauty" is a visually appealing drama with a lighthearted atmosphere. The makeup transformations are fun and creative, adding a unique visual element to the story. However, the narrative can sometimes feel predictable. The drama addresses important issues, I wished it delved deeper into the complexities of its themes, rather than just scratching the surface of complex issues like self-esteem.<br><br>
Overall, True Beauty get 4 out of 5 stars. <br>
It is a sweet and entertaining serie to watch with a positive message about self-acceptance but don't expect groundbreaking plot twists. It is lighthearted rom-com with a touch of social commentary but it is very predictable, the only thing that encourage u to watch would probably be the humor and laughs. <br><br>

<h3>“”</h3><br>
<h4> The Story:</h4>
"Branding in Seongsu" intricately weaves a tale of unexpected connections and profound transformations. At its heart are Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho, two individuals whose paths diverge dramatically following an unforeseen incident that leads to a miraculous body swap. <br><br>
Na Eon stands as the epitome of success within the bustling corridors of a Seongsu marketing agency. As the youngest leader of the marketing team, she is revered for her unmatched prowess in every project she undertakes, earning her the status of a legend in the industry. Yet, her unwavering dedication to her career has exacted a toll on her personal life, leaving behind a trail of fractured friendships and unfulfilled romantic aspirations. <br><br>
On the flip side, we encounter Eun Ho, the embodiment of youthful exuberance and spontaneity. Known for his endearing charm and perpetual zest for life, he embodies the 'YOLO' philosophy with fervor, embracing each moment with infectious enthusiasm. However, his carefree existence takes an unexpected turn when circumstances compel him to enter the competitive realm of the job market. <br><br>
Their worlds collide in a whirlwind of chaos when an accidental kiss triggers an inexplicable phenomenon: their souls swap bodies. This happened on the night that Na Eon was almost murdered after the chaos of her latest business with XU beauty. Overnight, Na Eon finds herself navigating the complexities of internships and the laid-back lifestyle she once dismissed, while Eun Ho grapples with the pressures of leadership and the relentless demands of the corporate sphere. <br><br>
Initially at odds due to their contrasting values and perspectives, the forced intimacy of their situation brings Na Eon and Eun Ho closer together. As they traverse the unfamiliar terrain of each other's lives, they develop a newfound understanding and appreciation for the struggles they once belittled. Amidst the chaos and confusion, a tender and burgeoning romantic connection blossoms, transcending the boundaries of their physical identities. At the same time, Na Eon was using Eun Ho body to her advantage to catch her killer with a better physic and strength. <br><br>
Yet, their journey is fraught with challenges both personal and professional. As they endeavor to reverse the enigmatic body swap, they confront their deepest insecurities and confront the intricacies of human relationships. Through their shared ordeal, they embark on a profound exploration of identity, empathy, and the transformative power of love. <br><br>
That what we thought until we learn Eun Ho isn’t who we thought is. Eun Ho’s journey takes a darker turn as he delves into the past to seek justice for his late girlfriend, Nam-gung Da-Eun. Eun Ho, driven by grief and a thirst for justice, mistakenly believes that Kang Na Eon is responsible for his girlfriend’s death. This belief stems from a discovery that five years prior, Na Eon allegedly appropriated a proposal from a project crucial to Eun Ho and his girlfriend, Nam-gung Da-Eun. Convinced that Na Eon’s actions led to tragic consequences, Eun Ho embarks on a path of revenge, planning to make her pay for the perceived wrongdoing. <br><br>
Upon learning the truth, Eun Ho is faced with the reality of his actions and the misdirected anger he harbored towards Na Eon. This leads to a heartfelt apology from Eun Ho, as he grapples with his feelings of guilt and remorse for having wrongly accused her. She actually apologized for the event that happened 5years ago but the hard disk that she left was stolen by the higher of her company to be used against her later on. During this emotional exchange, Eun Ho also comes to terms with the growing feelings he has developed for Na Eon from thinking she was a cold person to a warm person but with a complex personality, adding a layer of complexity to their relationship. <br><br>
We learn at the end of the serie, that the killer was actually Min Hee-jung, Ne Eon boss and supporter, but also her actual killer. Eun Ho, overwhelmed by the words of Min Hee-jung who blamed him for the loss of his first love, Nam-gung Da-Eun, decides to take a break from his job and his relationship with Kang Na Eon. Stricken with grief, he leaves, promising to return once he has come to terms with the situation. After a year, he came back to Na Eon and lived a happy love life. <br><br>
<h4> My Opinion:</h4>
The story is so heart-warming. And seeing Lomon take on a new type of role just gave me goosebumps! So proud of how he managed to portray Eun Ho seamlessly, even when acting as Na Eon. Eun Ho portrayed a happy-go-lucky person, but lived with pain and revenge. And he became the plot twist of the drama. Na Eon portrayed as strong and brave, but lived with pain and regrets. When they come to terms with their sufferings, it gets so emotional. And the ending was so lovely! <br><br>
Overall, Branding is Seongsu get 5 and half out of 5 stars. <br>
The acting of the entire cast was really good. The storyline is described as very interesting and engaging. The soul-switching element is well-executed and doesn’t feel out of place. The drama get better with every episode. <br>
